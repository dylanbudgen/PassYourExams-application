## PassYourExam application
This is a project I worked on last year to help people study any topic in a quiz like fashion. The application was designed with the intention of allowing the community to create courses. 

This application is very much a work in progress.

### Cool features
* Several types of quiz questions: true/false, multiple options, images, info boxes
* Question activities are fully animated and smooth 
* Questions are read from a cached SQL database. This will be updatable with an API later allowing for remote updating of questions and downloadable question packs. 
* Lessons have a 'strength' value which increases with completely a lessoning and gradually decreases over time. Each module has a grade. 
* Advertisements after every few lessons (currently commented out for compatibility issues) 

### Things to do
* Modules grid has not been started
* Lessons grid needs improving
* Some classes are over-engineered
* UI needs a lot of work, graphics need to be designed
* Database of questions needs populating with modules
* Add other types of questions
